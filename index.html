            <p style="color: aquamarine;">Abstract:
            This project recreates the classic game Pac-Man using Python and the Pyxel library. Following the 
            project requirements, we have developed a functional version of the game. The code emphasizes 
            maintainability, readability, and extensibility to enable future enhancements and new features.</p>

                game using object-oriented programming. The game retains classic elements like PacMan, ghosts, pellets, and a maze, while introducing new features to enhance gameplay. 
                Designed for playability, it delivers a fun and engaging recreation of the arcade classic.
                The game integrates basic artificial intelligence and algorithms to simulate ghost 
                movements, adding challenge and strategy for players. Development involved 
                overcoming challenges with logical thinking and programming skills, including creating 
                custom sounds, intricate maps, and gameplay mechanics from scratch.</p>

                This project highlights technical proficiency and offers potential for future 
                improvements, such as smarter AI for ghosts, new power-ups, additional levels, and 
                refined visuals and sound for greater immersion.
                This document provides a detailed report on the project’s development, covering its 
                logic, algorithms, design choices, and challenges. It includes diagrams and illustrations to 
                explain the game’s structure, flow, and components, offering a comprehensive 
                understanding of its architecture.
                By combining creativity and understanding of coding, this project demonstrates the 
                successful application of programming concepts, problem solving and innovation to 
                create an enjoyable and functional game</p>
